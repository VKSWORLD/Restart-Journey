- LeetCode Easy: Valid Parentheses (stack implementation)  

⚠️ Attempted:  
- Daily Medium DSA problem: Closest Node (needs graph knowledge)

🧠 Reflection:  
Felt good solving easy problems with stacks and custom functions. Need to focus more on graph theory and medium DSA concepts for daily challenges. Consistency is key.

## Day 7 – May 30, 2025

✅ Completed:
- JS Array revision with map/filter/reduce
- 2 custom exercises on logic and factorials
